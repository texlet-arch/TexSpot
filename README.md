## 🚩 News
- **[2026.02]** Repository initialized. We are currently preparing the codebase for public release following the anonymous review process.




## 📅 TODO
We are committed to open-sourcing the full implementation of TexSpot. The release is planned as follows:

- [ ] **Core Inference Code**.
- [ ] **Pre-trained Models**: Weights for 3D texture enhancement.
- [ ] **Preprocessing Toolkit**: Scripts for generating spatially-uniform point distributions.
- [ ] **Full Training Pipeline**: End-to-end optimization code.
- [ ] **Interactive Demo**: Gradio-based web interface for local testing.
